DistoTV
===========
I started this because I miss Disto::Fx on Linux
I was thinking there should be something like that on Linux,
some dynamic distortion plug-in(whit lot of diffident clipping methods)
The idea is that you should be able to paint a distortion curve on the TV screen,
then the curve should be applied to a base curve like power-cosine or something to start with.

Right now it was more intresting to applay the just the graph from the TVscreen as clipping methods
But the clipping scale could be better in the future.

I love making noisy music, I listen to a lot of old industrial music like Cabaret Voltaire or Psychic TV.
I'm noob to programming, I know the basics, took courses in c++ when I was younger.

You are more then welcome to do whatever you want whit the code, I would love to see what that would look like :)

This is not done, but I can use it with kxstudio ubuntu 14.04, vst and jack


TO DO

1. Finish dsp programming
2. Add default presets

other ui stuff

interpolation menu on the left bottom corner
channel menu on the left botton corner(for different waves at the same time)
base wave widget with menu under the tv
preset menu to the right

graph reset botton
smoth botton

(in the future)
There could should be a menu where you can choose from different base curves and maybe see them.
Add more knobs for different distortions and make some build in “analog tape saturation VHS style”.
Characterize the filter(right now its taken from 3bandEQ). There should be different kinds of interpolation methods.

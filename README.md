DistoTV
===========
I started this because I miss Disto::Fx on Linux
I was thinking there should be something like that on Linux,
some dynamic distortion plug-in(whit lot of diffident clipping methods)
The idea is that you should be able to paint a distortion curve on the TV screen,
then the curve should be applied to diffrent "smoothing" or interpolation methods and diffrent scales


I love making noisy music, I listen to a lot of old industrial music like Cabaret Voltaire or Psychic TV.
I'm noob to programming, I know the basics, took courses in c++ when I was younger.

You are more then welcome to do whatever you want with the code, I would love to see what that would look like :)

THIS IS NOT FINISHED BUT IT CAN BE USED


TO DO

graph reset button

smooth functionality

redesign "graphic to dsp"

program interpolation

remove some knobs and cleanup ui

design ui



It also comes with a plugin called RandomMIDIcc for now
this plugin sends random midicc data

DistoTV
===========
I started this because I miss Disto::Fx on Linux
I was thinking there should be something like that on Linux,
some dynamic distortion plug-in(whit lot of diffident clipping methods)
The idea is that you should be able to paint a distortion curve on the TV screen,
then the curve should be applied to diffrent "smoothing" or interpolation methods and diffrent scales


I love making noisy music, I listen to a lot of old industrial music like Cabaret Voltaire or Psychic TV.
I'm noob to programming, I know the basics, took courses in c++ when I was younger.

You are more then welcome to do whatever you want with the code, I would love to see what that would look like :)

THIS IS NOT FINISHED BUT IT CAN BE USED


TO DO

* Improve DSP

* Graph reset button

* Smooth functionality

* Redesign "graphic to dsp"

* Program interpolation

* Remove some knobs and cleanup ui

* Design ui



It also comes with a plugin called RandomMIDIcc for now
this plugin sends random midicc data
